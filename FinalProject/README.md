# Museum of Candy Java Spring

This is my first readme file for my GitHub repo so bear with me for any information that is lacking or esoteric!

My website is about a fictitious pop-up candy exhibit, Museum of Candy. It was created using Bootstrap, Javascript, Java MVC Spring, and a MySQL database. The design layout was taken from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp and the descriptions/pictures were taken from https::/www.candytopia.com and https://unsplash.com respectively.

The website itself has 5 pages (3 of which can be navigated to using the navbar):

* Home
* About
* Sign Up
* User Form page
* Results page

The about page has 3 pictures and 3 descriptions about Museum of Candy. The sign up page directs users to a user form page where they can fill out a form with 9 inputs and register with Museum of Candy. The form is submitted and the inputs are stored in a database in MySQL. The recently inserted data is then fetched and displayed on the results page. 

Screenshots of each page can be found below:
